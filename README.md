What is Berkeley Public Schools Fund?
----
**[Berkeley Public Schools Fund](berkeleypublicschoolsfund.org)** is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to inspire and empower an extraordinary public education for every child. The Berkeley Public Schools Fund invests directly in teachersâ€™ ideas and creativity with classroom and districtwide program grants and volunteer support in the classroom.
Every year the Schools Fund awards approximately 300 classroom and districtwide grants, serving 9,000 students, 19 schools, and 550 teachers and totaling $500,000. This, coupled with our volunteer program, means every year they contribute $1.5 million in grants and in-kind donations.

What We Are Doing
----
The Schools Fund believed in a mission to encourage a stronger and more involved relationship between teachers and the parents of students. This grant platform is designed to crowdfund donations towards teacher projects while targeting a specific audience. In the future, the Schools Fund will use this application to replace their entire grant application system.
The application is currently LIVE!!! **[here.](https://schoolsfund-friendsandfamily.herokuapp.com/)**
