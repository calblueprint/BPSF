What is Berkeley Public Schools Fund?
----
**[Berkeley Public Schools Fund](berkeleypublicschoolsfund.org)** is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to inspire and empower an extraordinary public education for every child. The Berkeley Public Schools Fund invests directly in teachersâ€™ ideas and creativity with classroom and districtwide program grants and volunteer support in the classroom.
Every year the Schools Fund awards approximately 300 classroom and districtwide grants, serving 9,000 students, 19 schools, and 550 teachers and totaling $500,000. This, coupled with their volunteer program, means they contribute $1.5 million in grants and in-kind donations every year.

What We Are Doing
----
The Schools Fund believed in a mission to encourage a stronger and more involved relationship between teachers and the parents of students. This grant platform helps teachers crowdfund donations from the school's local community.
